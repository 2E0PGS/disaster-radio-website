Software development will be heavily dependent on a Secure Scuttlebutt like protocol.  

## Routing
The routing protocol used for the disaster.radio network is currently being developed. We have a network simulator written in Python. [Try it out](https://jemucino.github.io/disaster-radio-netsim/) and see how it could be [improved](https://github.com/sudomesh/disaster-radio-netsim).  

## Applications
 disaster.radio will launch with three software applications:  

### Chat
Accessible by typing in the nodes ip address. See more about this under [User Guides](/learn/user-guides)

### Maps
[Feature in progress](https://github.com/sudomesh/disaster-radio/issues/10)
