disaster.radio is an entirely open-source, collaborative project between [Sudo Mesh](https://sudoroom.org/wiki/Mesh) and [Secure Scuttlebutt](https://github.com/ssbc) to build a resilient, low-bandwidth, long-range mesh network for off-grid and emergency communications.  

Built on affordable open hardware, powered by solar energy, and integrated with decentralized software, the disaster.radio device is currently in the prototype/development phase. To learn more about the technologies driving our development visit the following pages:
